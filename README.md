# UFO_Challenge

**Overview**

Purpose of this challenge was to assemble a web page whre you could filter UFO sightings based on date, location(city and state), and shape of the possible sighting. The filter 
is automatically updated when you enter in paramaters that you wish to view. 


**Results**

To complete a search, simply add in the parameters that you would like to view in the designated search field. Shown below is a search of January 10th, 2010. The other filters listed are place holders and do not filter until something is typed into the field.

**Summary**

One drawback to this webpage is that there is limited data. Only about 100 instances of UFO's sighting in the data set. 

Additional things that could be added to the page are a larger list of data or possibly a refreshable data source so you're always getting the most up to data information.
